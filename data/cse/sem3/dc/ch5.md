**CHAPTER 5**

**5. TRANSMISSION MEDIA**\
The transmission media is nothing but the physical media over which
communication takes place in computer networks.

**5.1 Magnetic Media**\
One of the most convenient ways to transfer data from one computer to
another, even before the birth of networking, was to save it on some
storage media and transfer physical from one station to another. Though
it may seem old-fashion way in today's world of high speed internet, but
when the size of data is huge, the magnetic media comes into play.

For example, a bank has to handle and transfer huge data of its
customer, which stores a backup of it at some geographically far-away
place for security reasons and to keep it from uncertain calamities. If
the bank needs to store its huge backup data, then its transfer through
internet is not feasible. The WAN links may not support such high speed.
Even if they do; the cost is too high to afford.

In these cases, data backup is stored onto magnetic tapes or magnetic
discs, and then shifted physically at remote places.

**5.2 Twisted Pair Cable**\
A twisted pair cable is made of two plastic insulated copper wires
twisted together to form a single media. Out of these two wires, only
one carries actual signal and another is used for ground reference. The
twists between wires are helpful in

reducing noise (electro-magnetic interference) and crosstalk.

There are two types of twisted pair cables:

> •Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) Cable
>
> •Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) Cable

STP cables comes with twisted wire pair covered in metal foil. This
makes it more

indifferent to noise and crosstalk.

UTP has seven categories, each suitable for specific use. In computer
networks,

Cat-5, Cat-5e, and Cat-6 cables are mostly used. UTP cables are
connected by

RJ45 connectors.

**5.3 Coaxial Cable**

Coaxial cable has two wires of copper. The core wire lies in the center
and it is

made of solid conductor. The core is enclosed in an insulating sheath.
The second

wire is wrapped around over the sheath and that too in turn encased by
insulator sheath. This all is covered by plastic cover.

> height="4.365277777777778in"}

Because of its structure, the coax cable is capable of carrying high
frequency signals than that of twisted pair cable. The wrapped structure
provides it a good shield against noise and cross talk. Coaxial cables
provide high bandwidth rates of up to 450 mbps.

There are three categories of coax cables namely, RG-59 (Cable TV),
RG-58 (Thin Ethernet), and RG-11 (Thick Ethernet). RG stands for Radio
Government.

Cables are connected using BNC connector and BNC-T. BNC terminator is
used to terminate the wire at the far ends.

**5.4 Power Lines**\
Power Line communication (PLC) is Layer-1 (Physical Layer) technology
which uses power cables to transmit data signals. In PLC, modulated data
is sent over the cables. The receiver on the other end de-modulates and
interprets the data.

Because power lines are widely deployed, PLC can make all powered
devices controlled and monitored. PLC works in half-duplex.

There are two types of PLCs:

> •Narrow band PLC\
> •Broad band PLC

Narrow band PLC provides lower data rates up to 100s of kbps, as they
work at lower frequencies (3-5000 kHz). They can be spread over several
kilometers. Broadband PLC provides higher data rates up to 100s of Mbps
and works at higher frequencies (1.8 -- 250 MHz). They cannot be as much
extended as Narrowband PLC.

**5.5 Fiber Optics**\
Fiber Optic works on the properties of light. When light ray hits at
critical angle, it tends to refracts at 90 degree. This property has
been used in fiber optic. The core of fiber optic cable is made of high
quality glass or plastic. From one end of it light is emitted, it
travels through it and at the other end light detector detects light
stream and converts it to electric data.

Fiber Optic provides the highest mode of speed. It comes in two modes,
one is single mode fiber and second is multimode fiber. Single mode
fiber can carry a single ray of light whereas multimode is capable of
carrying multiple beams of light.

Fiber Optic also comes in unidirectional and bidirectional capabilities.
To connect and access fiber optic special type of connectors are used.
These can be Subscriber Channel (SC), Straight Tip (ST), or MT-RJ.

**5.6 WIRELESS TRANSMISSION**\
Wireless transmission is a form of unguided media. Wireless
communication involves no physical link established between two or more
devices, communicating wirelessly. Wireless signals are spread over in
the air and are received and interpreted by appropriate antennas.

When an antenna is attached to electrical circuit of a computer or
wireless device, it converts the digital data into wireless signals and
spread all over within its frequency range. The receptor on the other
end receives these signals and converts them back to digital data.

A little part of electromagnetic spectrum can be used for wireless
transmission.

**5.7 Radio Transmission**\
Radio frequency is easier to generate and because of its large
wavelength it can penetrate through walls and structures alike. Radio
waves can have wavelength from 1mm -- 100,000km and have frequency
ranging from 3Hz (Extremely Low Frequency) to 300 GHz (Extremely High
Frequency). Radio frequencies are sub-divided into six bands.

Radio waves at lower frequencies can travel through walls whereas higher
RF can travel in straight line and bounce back. The power of low
frequency waves decreases sharply as they cover long distance. High
frequency radio waves have more power.

Lower frequencies such as VLF, LF, MF bands can travel on the ground up
to

1000 kilometers, over the earth's surface.

Radio waves of high frequencies are prone to be absorbed by rain and
other obstacles. They use Ionosphere of earth atmosphere. High frequency
radio waves such as HF and VHF bands are spread upwards. When they reach
Ionosphere, they

are refracted back to the earth.

**5.8 Microwave Transmission**\
Electromagnetic waves above 100MHz tend to travel in a straight line and
signals over them can be sent by beaming those waves towards one
particular station. Because Microwaves travels in straight lines, both
sender and receiver must be aligned to be strictly in line-of-sight.

Microwaves can have wavelength ranging from 1mm -- 1meter and frequency
ranging from 300MHz to 300GHz.

> ![](image45.png){width="4.145833333333333in"
> height="1.3444433508311462in"}

Microwave antennas concentrate the waves making a beam of it. As shown
in picture above, multiple antennas can be aligned to reach farther.
Microwaves have higher frequencies and do not penetrate wall like
obstacles.

Microwave transmission depends highly upon the weather conditions and
the frequency it is using.

**5.9 Infrared Transmission**\
Infrared wave lies in between visible light spectrum and microwaves. It
has wavelength of 700nm to 1mm and frequency ranges from 300GHz to
430THz. Infrared wave is used for very short range communication
purposes such as television and its remote. Infrared travels in a
straight line hence it is directional by nature. Because of high
frequency range, Infrared cannot cross wall-like obstacles.

**5.10 Light Transmission**\
Highest most electromagnetic spectrum which can be used for data
transmission is light or optical signaling. This is achieved by means of
LASER.

Because of frequency light uses, it tends to travel strictly in straight
line. Hence the sender and receiver must be in the line-of-sight.
Because laser transmission is unidirectional, at both ends of
communication the laser and the photo-detector needs to be installed.
Laser beam is generally 1mm wide hence it is a work of precision to
align two far receptors each pointing to lasers source.

> height="3.333332239720035in"}

Laser works as Tx (transmitter) and photo-detectors works as Rx
(receiver). Lasers cannot penetrate obstacles such as walls, rain, and
thick fog. Additionally, laser beam is distorted by wind, atmosphere
temperature, or variation in temperature in the path.

Laser is safe for data transmission as it is very difficult to tap 1mm
wide laser without interrupting the communication channel.
