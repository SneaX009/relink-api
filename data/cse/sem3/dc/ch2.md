**2. Signals**

When data is sent over physical medium, it needs to be first converted
into electromagnetic signals. Data itself can be analog such as human
voice, or digital such as file on the disk. Both analog and digital data
can be represented in digital or analog signals.

**2.1 Digital Signals**

Digital signals are discrete in nature and represent sequence of voltage
pulses. Digital signals are used within the circuitry of a computer
system.

**2.2 Analog Signals**\
Analog signals are in continuous wave form in nature and represented by
continuous electromagnetic waves.

**2.3Transmission Impairment**\
When signals travel through the medium, they tend to deteriorate. This
may have many reasons as given:

***2.3.1 Attenuation***\
For the receiver to interpret the data accurately, the signal must be
sufficiently strong. When the signal passes through the medium, it tends
to get weaker. As it covers distance, it loses strength.

***2.3.2 Dispersion***\
As signal travels through the media, it tends to spread and overlaps.
The amount of dispersion depends upon the frequency used.

***2.3.3 Delay distortion***\
Signals are sent over media with pre-defined speed and frequency. If the
signal speed and frequency do not match, there are possibilities that
signal reaches destination in Data Communication and Computer Network
arbitrary fashion. In digital media, this is very critical that some
bits reach earlier then the previously sent ones.

***2.3.4 Noise***

Random disturbance or fluctuation in analog or digital signal is said to
be Noise in

signal, which may distort the actual information being carried.
